The user is able to select a number of sides from the spinner.  Then they 
are able to say whether the die is loaded or not.  If so, they are able to 
select a loaded side not exceeding the number of sides from a spinner, as 
well as a load factor from the slider.

To roll the die, the user must click on the face of the die.  The game then
begins.
