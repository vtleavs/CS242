The Die class is very straightforward; all methods are one or two lines long,
and very easy to implement.

The LoadedDie class took a bit more time, because I had to figure out how
to load the die.

DiceArray was also very easy to implement.

The TestDice class implements and tests the Die and LoadedDie classs 
in a number of ways.

Methods:
    -   runs all the same testing on a single die as the previous iteration to 
        make sure that the changes to Die have not affected the results
    -   checks the load factor by rolling the die 10000 times at increments
        of 10% load factor

Notes:
    It was not clear exactly what the load factor was supposed to regulate,
    or at least how it was supposed to regulate it.  I took the assignment as
    meaning if load factor is 0%, the loaded side appears 0% of the time.  If 
    I were to do it the other way (load factor 0% means die is fair), I would 
    change the code:

        int newRoll = (int)rand.nextInt(numSides-1)+1;
        if(newRoll >= loadedSide)
            newRoll++;
        currentTop = newRoll;

    to 
        
        int newRoll = super.roll();
        currentTop = newRoll;
